# Starting out building in Python
# Creating two variables that will take user inputs as integers
x = 5
y = 25
print(x)
print(y)

# Using python f string
name = "Olivia"
house_number = 41
print(f"I am {name} and I live in house {house_number}.")

# This allows you to print these two numbers and it shows these two numbers
a = int(input("Enter a number"))
b = int(input("Enter a number"))
